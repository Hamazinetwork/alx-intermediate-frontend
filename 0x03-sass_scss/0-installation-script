## Installing and Running Sass on Windows

1. **Created a new folder** called `0x03-sass_scss`.

2. **Changed directory** into the newly created folder using the terminal.

3. **Visited the official Sass website** to check the documentation and understand the installation process.

4. **Installed Sass globally** using the command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g sass
   ```

5. **Ran** `npm fund` to confirm the installed packages and directory structure.

6. **Created the following `.scss` files** for practice:

   * `0-installation-script.scss`
   * `0-debug_log.scss`
   * `1-color_variable.scss`
   * `2-nested_tag.scss`
   * `3-mixin_margins.scss`

7. **Watched each file** using the Sass compiler by running:

   ```bash
   sass --watch input.scss output.css
   ```

8. **Faced an issue with Windows PowerShell**, which by default restricts script execution due to security policies.

9. **Resolved the script execution issue** by:

   * Opening PowerShell **as Administrator**.
   * Running the following command to change the execution policy:

     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```

10. **Returned to the terminal** and successfully executed the `sass --watch` command for each `.scss` file.
